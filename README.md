# KillrVideo Node.js

A reference application for Node.js developers looking to learn more about using 
[Apache Cassandra][cassandra] and [DataStax Enterprise][dse] in their applications and 
services. Learn more at [killrvideo.github.io][killrvideo].

## Running Locally using Docker

Running should be pretty straight-forward if you are familiar with docker and docker-compose

```
> docker-compose pull
> docker-compose build
> docker-compose up -d
```

## Contributing, Requests for More Examples

This project will continue to evolve along with Cassandra and you can expect that as 
Cassandra, DSE, and the drivers add new features, this application will try and provide 
examples of those.  We gladly accept any pull requests for bug fixes, new features, etc. and 
if you have a request for an example that you don't see in the code currently, feel free to
open an issue here on GitHub or send a message to [@LukeTillman][twitter] on Twitter.
